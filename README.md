# Qactus

A Flutter Android app (for now, iOS eventually coming) fetching latest articles from [Qactus.fr](https://www.qactus.fr), among other features. It's not meant to be fully featured, as it's a hobby project to better get the hang of Android and Flutter. 

## Getting Started

I'm using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with Flutter plugin from the marketplace.

Here is a great [step-by-step guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on how to install it all.

Once done, you can pull my repo and have fun!
